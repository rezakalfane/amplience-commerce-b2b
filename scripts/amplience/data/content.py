            "In B2B, the price on the shelf is rarely the price a customer pays. Contract pricing is the practice of showing each account the price they negotiated, and it is the foundation of any serious wholesale portal.",
            ("Why list prices fall short", "Most B2B relationships are governed by agreements: a fixed price for a year, a percentage off a category, or a volume break that kicks in at a pallet.

Contract pricing removes that doubt by showing the negotiated number everywhere, from search results to the cart."),
